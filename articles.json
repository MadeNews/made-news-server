The hungry people get a free meal, and Rasputin gets a never-ending buffet of human snacks.\" When asked about the ethics of feeding humans to a bear, Putin shrugged, \"Hey, it's not like I'm the first world leader to use humans as food for my pets. Ask Henry VIII about his pet lions.**\n\nThe plan, dubbed \"Hunger-B-Gone,\" has already gained traction among Putin's closest allies, including Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, who has offered to provide a fleet of refrigerated trucks to transport the hungry masses to the Kremlin. \"It's a small price to pay for the opportunity to dine on the finest human cuisine,\" Lukashenko said in a statement.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel was overheard muttering \"not again\" as she rolled her eyes and dispatched a team of diplomats to Madrid to try and talk Sánchez down from his imperial high horse. Meanwhile, US President Joe Biden was seen frantically googling \"What is Spain?\" as he struggled to come up with a coherent response. Russian President Vladimir Putin, meanwhile, simply shrugged and said \"Hey, as long as he doesn't try to annex Siberia, I'm good.\"\n\nAs the international community teeters on the brink of chaos, Sánchez has announced plans to hold a lavish coronation ceremony in Madrid's Royal Palace, featuring a performance by Shakira and a buffet of paella and tapas.
